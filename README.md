# Org-Formation Reference

This repository builds out a reference architecture to highlight some of the core services, building blocs and approaches that will help you build out a multi-account best practice AWS landing zone, using an open source tool called [AWS Organization Formation (OrgFormation)](https://github.com/org-formation) by [Olaf Conijn](https://twitter.com/OConijn). 

The content can be developed following along with a series of blog posts:

* Part 1: Initial setup up a multi-account AWS environment
* Part 2: Adding AWS SSO and controlling permissions
* Part 3: Centralising security services
* Part 4: Budget Alerts and reporting

The intention is that this repository cannot be run as it stands, as any personal information such as email addresses and account IDs have been replaced with tokens in this format - <<token-format>>
